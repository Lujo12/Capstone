\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Project Overview}
  The project is part of a proposal to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This proposal wants to decentralize control of unmanned vehicles, and allows multiple operators to operate a single vehicle or a formation of vehicles. This provides redundancy in the decision process and optimize the course of action to be followed. The main focus is the image segmentation and processing part. The images will be classify using a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) depending on the following features:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shape
    \item Color
    \item Location
    \item Normalized Area
    \item Texture
  \end{itemize}

\section{Project Organization}
This section is divided in the following subsections:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Process Model
  \item Organizational Structure
  \item Organizational Boundaries and Interfaces
  \item Project Responsibilities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Process Model}
The organization for the development of the software's documents (SRS, STD, SDD, SPMP and Smart EyeSight Code) will be paralleled, lineal and incremental. Each member will have a document assigned, this way the documents can be completed by the due date the client specify.\\\\
The following figure (\ref{org_struct}) shows the process model of the project.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=6.0in]{block_diagram_Org_Struct}\\
  \caption{Block Diagram of the Process Model}\label{org_struct}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Organizational Structure}
AIIPS is compose of 3 members, each with a main position in the team, primary and secondary tasks. The following figure (\ref{org_diagram}) shows the positions within the organization, the primary and Secondary Tasks of each member:

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=6.0in]{org_diagram}\\
  \caption{Organizational Diagram}\label{org_diagram}
  \end{figure}
  
Decisions within the Company are handled through voting. The changes must be discussed by the group, after which a debate will take place to find the advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the group will vote and majority decided whether the change will take place. Each meeting will be documented in the weekly report.\\\\
Communication between group members will consist of phone calls, text messages and meetings. Generally, meetings take place every Wednesday at 1:30pm with additional meetings taking place during whenever the group decides is necessary.

\subsection{Organizational Boundaries and Interfaces}
As section 1 of this documents says the main purpose/objective in the project is to implement the image segmentation/processing of the DARPA proposal. For the purpose of testing 150 images were selected to verify the effectiveness of Smart EyeSight (Please refer to the STD Document for more information). In a real situation Smart EyeSight will be receiving images from an external agent, robot and/or UAV. Then the images will be segmented and classify and the classification will be send to the external agent. Other companies/organizations will take care of the other components of this proposal.\\\\
Figure \ref{boundaries} shows the relevant parts for this project of the DARPA proposal. We don't care who or how the other agents do their work, our only concern is to have images as input to our Software.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=6.0in]{boundaries}\\
  \caption{Block Diagram of the Boundaries of our Project}\label{boundaries}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Project Responsibilities}
It is important to note that there will be at least one manager per document. The manager(s) of the document will be listed with the documents type also indicating the other member(s) that were assigned to work under that document.Tables \ref{RespMem}-\ref{RespSPMP} shows the responsibilities of each member.

\section{Managerial Processes}
This section is divided in the following subsections:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Management objectives and priorities
  \item Project assumptions, dependencies and constraints
  \item Risk management techniques 
  \item Monitoring and controlling mechanisms to be used
  \item Staffing Plan
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Management Objectives and Priorities}
This section contains the philosophy, goals and priorities on management activities for the project. Also it specify the format used for reporting and the expected frequency of reports, priorities of requirements, schedule and budget.

\subsubsection{Philosophy}
The philosophy adopted for the management of activities is: divide and conquer. The group will usually meet; either physically or via other means of communication, such as, internet conference calls using Skype or phone calls. Afterwards, the activity is discussed by the members and decomposed into essential parts or tasks required for the activity completion which are then assigned to the corresponding member.

\subsubsection{Goals}
The goals are simply to be able to fulfill the objectives of this stage of the Proposal and writing each document as fast as possible so we can have feedback from our client, review, audit and proceed to the next activity. 

\subsubsection{Priorities}
The priorities on an activity may vary on the difficulty and/or length of the activity. The order established for the main activity priorities are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Documenting the plan (SPMP) and the requirements (SRS) of the Project.
  \item Documenting the design (SDD) and testing methods (STD) of the Project.
  \item Work on AIIPS Software.
  \item Meet with our client for feedback.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Project Budget Priorities}
The priority on the project budget allocation is the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Computers for the project staff
  \item Required hardware and software for the project’s completion. (Refer to section 4.1 for list of software and hardware)
  \item Papers and books necessary for a better understanding of the process/steps to complete this Project. (Refer to sections 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 for list of papers and books)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Risk Management Procedures}
In the event that a risk or problematic situation occurs during the development of the project, an emergency staff meeting will take place in order to address the problem or situation. On these meeting it’s imperative to hear each of the staff member’s opinion and possible solutions on the matter. Afterwards the project staff will proceed to make a democratic vote election to determinate the course of action to be taken based on the proposed or accepted solutions to the given risk or problem.

\subsubsection{Software Acquisition Statement Management}
The proper format to deliver a statement which states the intention of acquiring, modifying or using existing software should follow the following procedure:

\begin{itemize}
  \item	Mention the Software in question during a staff meeting.
  \item State the reasons why the existing software is needed.
  \item Mention and justify the amount of software licenses needed
  \item Afterwards the staff in democratic vote will decide to acquire the software or not.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints}
This section will contain the following information:
 
 \begin{itemize}
   \item The necessary assumptions on which the project is based.
   \item External events the project is dependent upon in order to be completed.
   \item Constraints on which the project will be conducted.
 \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
The assumptions for this project are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The client already had design a complete robot/agent that captures video and audio.
  \item The client already had design the communication protocol to send the image and video.
  \item The client already had design the process/algorithm to take the video and divide it in frames/images.
  \item The staff assigned to system maintenance have knowledge of a PNN.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Most of the dependencies of external events the project will be dependent upon will be due the completion of the project documentations. For example SDD and STD documents will be dependent on the completion of the SRS and SPMP documentations in order for their completion to be successful. Other dependencies would be the feedback from our client that may change/alter the code and/or documents.
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The following are the constraints of the project:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Smart EyeSight have a time constraint of 3 months for documenting the software and 6 months to have a working code.
  \item Project documents must comply with IEEE software documentation format
  \item All the requirements mentioned in the SRS.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Risk Management}
This subsection identify and assess the risk factors associated with the project. It prescribe mechanisms for tracking the various risk factors and implementing contingency plans.

\subsubsection{Risk regarding contract}
  Examples would be not complying with the established deadline by the costumer. Another example would be violations of the contract terms from either end of the contract. These are the most common situations that may occur during project development.
\subsubsection{Risk’s regarding technology related on the project}
      An example would be damage received to project data resulting in it’s loss. Other situations that could occur are damage or theft of computer equipment or other materials.
\subsubsection{Risk’s regarding size and complexity of the product}
      An example of these risks would be that requirements and constraints of the project may require strong attention to detail and extensive documentation that may require more time that the established deadline. Another example could be disagreement on the design approach to solve a particular problem regarding the project’s development which may result on delaying progress on the project’s development.
\subsubsection{Risks regarding personnel acquisition and retention}
      Examples of these risks would be that a member may not have the required skill and expertise in order to perform assigned tasks which would hinder greatly the project’s development. Another example would be that a project staff member doesn’t complete the assigned task or that the completed task does not meet the expected standards. Another possible example would be the inconsistency of a project member to show up on meetings or having lack of communication with other project staff members resulting in a hindrance to the project’s development for not being in par with the progress of the project’s development.
\subsubsection{Risks regarding consumer acceptance of the product}
      Examples would be the customer may not express the desired resulting product correctly and mid development forces the staff member to redo most of the currently developed product on the project. Another example would be additional requests from the customer that may require drastic changes on the currently developed product.  Finally a risk example would be that the final product doesn’t comply with the requirements and constraints given by the client resulting in customer’s dissatisfaction, termination of the contract, revenue loss, loss of the company’s reputation, company bankruptcy and other undesired situations.

\subsection{Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms}
This section would briefly contain information about flow of information and controlling and auditing mechanisms as well as tools used in order to aid this task. These all apply to all the work packages regarding this project.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Flow of Information}\\\\
  Most of the information regarding the project is being kept digitally in documents stored as data on computers. Also information may flow via personal means or telecommunication tools such as cell phones, text messages, Skype conference calls , Dropbox  and GitHub Repository.
  \item \textbf{Review and Audit Mechanisms}\\\\
  The member assigned to each document will open and review the work done on the documentation using Dropbox or GitHub. We are going to use Latex to edit and modify each document. If changes are necessary to a current work done in order to comply with the requirements, constraints and IEEE standards, the editor will notify the staff member responsible of the work in question the necessary changes via any of the mentioned tools in Flow of Information. If necessary and the editor in chief has the required skill and preparation, he may do the corresponding modifications to the work under review and audit.
  \item The tools used for Monitoring and controlling mechanisms are the following:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Dropbox
        \item GitHub
        \item WinEdt 7(Latex)
        \item Emacs (for Latex)
      \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Staffing Plan}
The Project can be developed with a small group consisting of three (3) members. They, however, have to meet the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Have Experience with C.
  \item Start working in August 13, 2012.
  \item Work until February 2013.
  \item Have time to attend meetings.

\subsection{Software Documentation}
The Process of documentation is based on the standard documents of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Here is a description of the documents that we use on this project.

\subsubsection{Software Project Management Plan}
The software project management plan is the controlling document for managing a software project; it defines the technical and managerial processes necessary to satisfy the project requirements.

\subsubsection{Software Requirements Specification}
The software requirements specification is an important part of the requirements process of the software life cycle and is used in design, implementation, project monitoring, verification and validation. It gives a complete description of the behavior of the system to be developed.

\subsubsection{Software Test Document}
The standardized test document can facilitate communication by providing a common frame of reference. Serves as a completeness checklist for the associated testing process; can also provide a baseline for the evaluation of the current test practices.

\subsubsection{Software Design Description}
The software design description is a representation of a software system that is used as a medium for communicating software design information. A representation of a software system is created to facilitate analysis, planning, implementation, and decision making.

\subsection{Project Support Functions}
For the first year after delivery, the software will receive software updates monthly if needed. After the first year the updates will be reduced to three for the year, every four months, before reaching the plateau at one every 6 months. The combination of routine maintenance and the updates are part of the quality assurance that guarantees that the system will work more efficiently.

\section{Work Packages, Schedule, and Budget}
This section specify the work packages, identify the dependency relationships among them, state the resource requirements, provide allocation of budget and resources to work packages, and establish a project schedule. This section is divided in the following subsections:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Work Packages
  \item Dependencies
  \item Resource Requirements
  \item Budget and Resource Allocation
  \item Schedule
\end{itemize}
